* Overview
** What is it?
  - A text editor
  - 40 years old (70's)
    - In human terms ~3600 BC
  - Steady growth
  - New renaissance b/c scripting languages
** Relevance
  - Hundreds of add-ons
  - Lots of batteries included
  - Works everywhere
  - Very well supported
    - #emacs
    - gnu.help.emacs
* Talk Description
** This talk ..
  - Not flame-bait
    + Also covers Emacs' faults
  - No knowledge required
  - Developer biased (because I am one)
  - But also applicable to sysadmins
  - Linux biased
** This talk ...
  - A whirlwind tour
  - No explanations of every keyboard shortcut
  - Yes, advanced material!
  - Not going for complete understanding
  - Defocus, magic-eye
  - Please ask questions!
* Basics
** Terminology
*** Emacs Window ...
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.6
    :END:
    [[file:emacs-components.png]]
   - `Window` == `buffer`
   - The whole thing is a `frame`
** Lifesavers
   - `Control-g` or `Esc` - quit whatever I'm doing
   - `C-/` - undo and _3_ other keybindings + 'Edit -> Undo'
** Minibuffer
   - Invoke with `M-x`
   - `M` == "Meta" == `Alt`
   - All your commands go here
   - `M-x find-file` opens a (new) file
** Self-help
   - `M-x describe-function` - view docs and _keyboard shortcuts_
   - `M-x describe-key` - what function does a shortcut invoke
   - `M-x describe-variable` - view docs and _current value_
   - `M-x info` - general Help facility
** Revisit Find-File
   - `M-x describe-function find-file`
** Self-help using Menu Example
   - View docs on `Insert File`
   - `M-x describe-key C-x i`
** Self-help with Toolbar
   - Requires slightly more experience
   - Know it's called a "toolbar"
   - Probably a map somewhere
   - Probably stored in a variable
   - Try `M-x describe-variable`
   - Also works with `minibuffer`
** Structured self-help
   - `M-x info`
* Undoing Changes
** Undo
   - State is never lost
   - `Redoing` is undoing an undo
   - Yes, it's confusing
** Undo-Tree
   - Visualize changes in a tree
   - Go back to any point
   - Timestamp changes
   - Diff mode
* Cut/Copy/Paste
** Cutting/Copying
   - All cuts and copy's are saved to the `kill-ring`
   - `C-y` pastes the most recent thing
   - `M-y` goes back in history
   - `M-x describe-variable kill-ring` - view the kill-ring
** Rectangle Mode
   - Select/delete/paste rectangular blobs of text
   - Good for column based editing
   - `ps -aux` example
      - keep only root processes with pids
   - Can't go past EOL
     - Vim's Visual block is much better
   - `df -h` example
     - Move mount points before the usage
** Picture mode
   - Drawing ASCII diagrams
   - Fixes all the issues with rectangle-mode
   - Can select arbitrary regions
* Working with code
** Occur-mode
   - Match and _edit_ lines that match regex
** Imenu
   - python example
* Org Mode
** Org-beamer
   - this talk
** Org-babel
   - Show code file
** Org-table
   - Simple Table
   - Df revisited
